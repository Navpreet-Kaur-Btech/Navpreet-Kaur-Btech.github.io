**ABOUT MY CODING JOURNEY**


**When I first started learning to code, I was a complete novice. The world of programming seemed vast and complex, but Hardeep Rai Sir made it accessible and engaging. His teaching methods were clear and structured, which helped me build a strong foundation in coding. Through his lessons, I learned various things , starting with the basics and gradually moving on to more advanced concepts.*

**Under his mentorship, I not only grasped the technical aspects of coding but also learned how to approach problems logically and systematically. He encouraged me to think critically and develop solutions independently, fostering a deep understanding of the subject. His support and encouragement played a crucial role in boosting my confidence as a coder.*

**As I progressed, I began working on small projects, applying the skills I had learned. This hands-on experience was invaluable, allowing me to see the practical applications of coding and further igniting my passion for it.* 



**Thank You**
**Have A Good Day**
